This guide provides an overview of common open source licensing options, ranging from most restrictive ([No License](/developers/source-code/license#no-license-none)) to least restrictive ([The Unlicense](/developers/source-code/license#public-domain-the-unlicense-unlicense)).

---

## No License (None)

- By default, all creative works (including software) are automatically protected by copyright law. Without explicitly choosing a license, others cannot legally use, modify, or distribute your code. This default protection may be more restrictive than intended - choosing an open source license (described below) allows others to use your code while maintaining your copyright.

## The Unlicense (Unlicense)

- The most permissive option, dedicating your work to the public domain. Users can do anything with the code without any conditions - including using it in closed-source projects without attribution.
